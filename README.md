# 🍽️ MealTrek - Food Delivery Website

## Project Overview
MealTrek is a feature-rich and visually engaging food delivery platform built as part of an academic capstone project for the SNW subject. The project demonstrates modern web development best practices using **HTML5** and **CSS3** (Phase 1), with a modular structure that is ready for JavaScript enhancements (Phase 2). MealTrek is fully responsive and designed to give users a smooth food ordering experience.
